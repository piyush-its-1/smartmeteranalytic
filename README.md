This project uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available in this repo.

Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
•	Led a team of 5 members to provide a solution to a problem of rising data volume and velocity in a cost effective way.
•	Designing and algorithm part was a solo operation as team leader.
•	Rest part of coding, testing, report and presentation was divided and performed in a collective manner.
•	On time delivery was made with still 2 days left to deadline.  

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
## This is a project made by "PIYUSH PANDEY" of ITS ENGG college for the summer internship of 6 weeks for Sopra Steria 
## under Ritika Sharma of sopra steria and Ashish Kumar H.O.D. CSE at ITS ENGG
